# Vector-HaSH: Memory Spatial Scaffold Implementation

## Introduction

The memory spatial scaffold is a foundational structure for organizing spatial information in a cognitive architecture. This document describes the Vector-HaSH (Vector Hashing for Spatial Hierarchies) approach, which provides an efficient implementation of a spatial scaffold without heteroassociations.

## Basic Principles

Vector-HaSH uses vector representations to encode spatial locations and relationships in a hierarchical structure. The core principles include:

1. **Vector Representation**: Spatial locations are encoded as high-dimensional vectors
2. **Hierarchical Organization**: Locations are organized in a multi-level hierarchy
3. **Hash-Based Indexing**: Fast access and retrieval using a hashing mechanism
4. **Similarity-Based Relations**: Spatial relations determined by vector similarity metrics

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **SpatialVector**: The basic unit representing a location in space
2. **SpatialScaffold**: The overall structure managing the hierarchy of spatial vectors
3. **VectorHashIndex**: An efficient indexing system for rapid retrieval of similar vectors

### Data Structures

The spatial scaffold is implemented using the following data structures:

- Vectors represented as numpy arrays
- Hierarchical tree structure for organizing spatial regions
- Hash tables for efficient lookup

### Key Algorithms

1. **Vector Creation**: Methods to generate and normalize spatial vectors
2. **Distance Calculation**: Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance functions
3. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Organizing vectors into hierarchical structures
4. **Vector Hashing**: Locality-sensitive hashing for fast similarity search

## API Design

The basic API will include:

- `create_spatial_vector(coordinates)`: Create a new spatial vector
- `add_to_scaffold(vector, level)`: Add a vector to the scaffold at a specific level
- `find_nearest(vector, k=1)`: Find k nearest vectors in the scaffold
- `navigate(start_vector, direction_vector)`: Navigate from one location to another

## Usage Example

```python
from spatial_scaffold import SpatialScaffold, SpatialVector

# Create a new scaffold
scaffold = SpatialScaffold(dimensions=64, levels=3)

# Add locations to the scaffold
location_a = SpatialVector([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...])  # Simplified vector
location_b = SpatialVector([0.15, 0.25, 0.35, ...])  # Simplified vector

scaffold.add_location(location_a)
scaffold.add_location(location_b)

# Find nearest location
nearest = scaffold.find_nearest(SpatialVector([0.12, 0.22, 0.32, ...]))

# Navigate between locations
path = scaffold.navigate(location_a, location_b)
