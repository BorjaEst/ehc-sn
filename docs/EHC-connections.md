# The Entorhinal-Hippocampal Circuit

## Hippocampal Subfields

The hippocampus contains several distinct regions that form the trisynaptic circuit:

### DG

HPC Gateway; Pattern Separation; Neurogenesis; Novelty detection.

- Contains mossy cells and GABAergic interneurons
- EHC Inputs: [MEC II]

### CA3

Autoassociation Network; Pattern Completion; One-shot learning; Place cells.

- Receives input from dentate gyrus mossy fibers and entorhinal cortex
- Projects to CA1 and CA2 via Schaffer collaterals
- Has extensive recurrent connections within itself
- Functions in memory encoding, consolidation, and sequence generation
- EHC Inputs: [MEC II, DG, CA3 (strong)]

### CA2

Modulates HPC dynamics; SWR generation; Unique plasticity profile.

- Small region between CA1 and CA3
- Receives input from entorhinal cortex layer II
- Contains pyramidal cells similar to CA3
- EHC Inputs: [MEC II, CA3, *CA2, *Subiculum]

### CA1

HPC output; Contextual encoding and retrieval; Memory Consolidation (via SWRs);
Compares “expected” (CA3-memories) with “actual” sensory information (EC-observ)

- Receives input from CA3 via Schaffer collaterals
- Outputs to the subiculum
- Projects to layer V of the entorhinal cortex
- EHC Inputs: [MEC III, CA3, CA2, *CA1]

### Subiculum

- Serves as the main output of the hippocampus
- Projects to multiple brain areas (nucleus accumbens, septal nuclei, prefrontal cortex, etc.)
- Neurons can switch between bursting and single spiking modes
- Involved in spatial processing, stress regulation, working memory, and addiction mechanisms
- Includes several subregions: prosubiculum, presubiculum, postsubiculum, and parasubiculum
- Contains specialized cells like head direction cells (postsubiculum) and grid cells (parasubiculum)
- EHC Inputs: [MEC III, CA3, CA1(primary)]

## Clinical Significance

- Early Alzheimer's disease affects the entorhinal cortex, particularly its lateral region
- EC stimulation can improve spatial memory and navigation abilities
- The subiculum is implicated in epilepsy and the spread

## Medial Entorhinal Cortex (EC)

The entorhinal cortex serves as the main interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. It's crucial for memory, navigation, and time perception.
Divided into medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) regions, this application studies the MEC circuit.

### Layer II

- Grid cells, Boundary cells
- Attractor dynamics
- EHC Inputs: [MEC Vb]

### MEC Layer III

- Speed cells, head direction cells, boundary
- Major gateway from the neocortex to the hippocampus.
- EHC Inputs: [MEC Vb]

### MEC Layer Va

- Lower excitability, integrator cells
- Project to neocortex (other brain areas)
- EHC Inputs: [MEC Vb]

### MEC Layer Vb

- Higher excitability, input receiver
- Input receiver from hippocampus
- EHC Inputs: [MEC II, CA1, Subiculum]

### MEC Layer VI
